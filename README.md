# The GalNet Client Repository!
### GalNet (short for Galaxy Net) is an open-source chatting/backend service made by I, my girlfriend, and a few of friends!

The client for GalNet which is the frontend that users will use use to talk to one another on a messaging server!

You can send text, images and create a profile from the client!

We are still working on the frontend, as well as the backend. So stick around if you'd like :3
